*Plex VDR Live Plugin*

This is a very simple and first version of python plugin for Plex to stream live TV from my VDR to my iOS Devices.

Requirements:

a running VDR installation
vdr-plugin-streamdev
vdr-plugin-restfulapi

Install:

1) copy the .bundle part to your Plex plugin folder. On my system (ubuntu 12.04LTS) it's here:

/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins

2) Set permissions so the user plex is running under can run this and make the .py files executable.

Examples:

chown -R plex:plex 'VDR Live.bundle'
chmod +x 'VDR Live.bundle/Content/Code/__init__.py'

3) Restart Plex
4) Enjoy the Stream in your Plexclient

Known issues:

* No Streaming under WindowsRT
* Plex may not release the Streamdev-Client-Slot
